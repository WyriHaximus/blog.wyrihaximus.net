The past few weeks have been really tiring for me. So I'm taking a break this week from the usual posts in this series. Instead I'm doing a shout out to people who are working hard on getting ReactPHP in the picture or building awesome things with it.

<!-- More -->

Here is to all the people in this post and any I forgot for helping shape a more async PHP!

##### Igor (igorw) & Chris (cboden) #####

Both Chris and Igor stood at the birth of what would evolve into ReactPHP. Initially Chris started working on [Rachet](https://github.com/ratchetphp/Ratchet) before Igor's [ReactPHP](https://github.com/reactphp/) project a couple of years ago. These days they are both project owners & overseers of ReactPHP.

##### Christian a.k.a. Clue #####

[Christian LÃ¼ck](https://github.com/clue) is building a lot of small network related packages. Such as a [SSDP package (UPnP)](https://github.com/clue/php-ssdp-react), an [Asterisk Manager Interface](https://github.com/clue/php-ami-react), a [Server-Sent Events server](https://github.com/clue/php-sse-react), a [multicast DNS](https://github.com/clue/php-mdns-react), even a package for [UPD multicast](https://github.com/clue/php-multicast-react). Christian also lends a hand in a lot of code reviews on the ReactPHP repo's.

##### Christopher a.k.a. assertchris #####

[Christopher](https://github.com/assertchris) has been doing a great job giving [talks](https://speakerdeck.com/chrispitt/async-php-1) in various places. Haven't seen a lot of his code work yet but will definitely keep an eye on what he comes up with!

##### Recoil & icicle.io #####

[RecoilPHP](https://github.com/recoilphp) (by [James](https://github.com/jmalloc)) & [icicle.io](https://github.com/icicleio) (by [Aaron](https://github.com/trowski)) are two packages dealing with coroutines in PHP. [Nikita](https://github.com/nikic) wrote a [blog post](https://nikic.github.io/2012/12/22/Cooperative-multitasking-using-coroutines-in-PHP.html) on the subject back in 2012 which is well worth checking out!

##### Daniel a.k.a. rdlowrey #####

[Daniel](https://twitter.com/rdlowrey) among things wrote two RFC's (both accepted), [Generator Return Expressions](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/generator-return-expressions) and [Generator Delegation](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/generator-delegation), at least one of those will help aid progress PHP into more async support.  

##### Michael a.k.a. mtdowling #####

While not technically working with ReactPHP (AFAIK) [Michael](https://github.com/mtdowling) the author of [Guzzle](http://guzzle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). And with Guzzle's v5 release it supports [promises](/2015/02/reactphp-promises/) (called futures within Guzzle). That is a major step forward in supporting both sync and async code styles and I would love to see other package owners made a similar more when it's appropriate.

##### Many others #####

There are more others out there doing awesome things with ReactPHP. I can't name everyone in one post but these are some of the first that come to mind when talking about ReactPHP.
