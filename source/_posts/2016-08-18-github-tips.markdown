[`Github`](https://github.com/) has fundamentally changed the opensource landscape, especially for those among us remembering the sourceforge days. While Github is powerful out of the box there are some tips, tricks, and browser addons that can be used to improve the experience.

# Tips

# Tricks

# Browser addons

The default experience on [github.com](https://github.com/) is powerful by default but these addons amp it up a notch.

## OctoLinker (![Chrome](/images/browsers/chrome_24x24.png)/![Firefox](/images/browsers/firefox_24x24.png)/![Opera](/images/browsers/opera_24x24.png))

[`OctoLinker`](https://github.com/OctoLinker/browser-extension/) OctocLinker is a great time server, when in a `composer.json` it lets you click a dependency taking you to that dependency's repository. No need to look it up on [`packagist`](https://packagist.org/) anymore, the addon does that for you.

## Isometric Contributions (![Chrome](/images/browsers/chrome_24x24.png)/![Firefox](/images/browsers/firefox_24x24.png)/![Safari](/images/browsers/safari_24x24.png))

[`Isometric Contributions`](https://github.com/jasonlong/isometric-contributions) is mainly just a fancy, and have to admint very cool, way of displaying your contribution graph.

## PixelBlock (![Chrome](/images/browsers/chrome_24x24.png))

While [`PixelBlock`](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixelblock/jmpmfcjnflbcoidlgapblgpgbilinlem?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog) isn't technically a Github browser addon, it is a Gmail browser addon. It blocks tracking pixels in emails, Github's tracking pixels included. As mentioned before I watch all projects and repositories I'm involved with and that can lead to a lot of email at times. The issues with Github's tracking pixel is that when you read the mail it will also mark those comments tracked on github.com. That is fine but it if you also use [github.com's unread notifications](https://github.com/notifications) you lost track of those on the website.
