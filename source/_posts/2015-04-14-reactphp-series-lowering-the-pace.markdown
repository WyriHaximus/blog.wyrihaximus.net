The past couple of months have been an great but tiring experience. The response was overwhelming but the weekly posts end today.

<!-- More -->

One of the reasons I'm taking this decision is because writing is hard and doing it every is week even harder. It tires me a lot so I'm stopping with writing every week. That, however doesn't mean that I'm done with the series! There will be at least 3 more posts to follow with time. Taking more time to write them allows for better quality posts without pressure.

Some things you will see in future is Message Queue's and a small sample application. These are large posts I can not do in just a week. Thank you for understanding, and be patient for my new posts!
