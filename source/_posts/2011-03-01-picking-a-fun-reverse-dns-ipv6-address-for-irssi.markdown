The otherday I was looking for a cool IPv6 address to use with IRSSI as reverse DNS. ([A Pingdom article inspired me.](http://royal.pingdom.com/2009/02/06/ipv6-playtime-hiding-sentences-inside-addresses/)) The old one was a numeric IPv6 representation of the server running it so it had to be something more fun and cool :). So with some other people (my girlfriend (for some reason she came op with b00b :P), [Thor](http://thorerik.net/) and some random Google searches helped me putting together a simple list

- :face:b00c ([Facebook](http://facebook.com))
- :tac0:be11 ([Taco Bell](http://www.tacobell.com/))
- :101 (lol)
- :f00d (food)
- :beef (beef)
- :10ad (load)
- :de11 ([Dell](http://dell.com/))
- :dead (dead)
- :b00b (boob)
- :51e7 ([slet](http://translate.google.com/#nl|en|slet))
- :c0de (code)
- :bee2 (beer)
- :babe (babe)
- :abba ([ABBA](http://www.abbasite.com/))
- :a11:baba ([Ali Baba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Baba))
- :ca75 (cats)	
- :d09s (dogs)


Picked :101:ca75 ([LOL Cats](icanhascheezburger.com)) as new IPv6 to use :). Now I'm off figuring out  fun addresses  for [WyriMaps](https://wyrimaps.net/wow) and [WoW-Screenshot](https://wow-screenshots.net/) content subdomains ;).
