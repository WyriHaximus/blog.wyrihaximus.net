Since I started using Wordpress a few weeks ago 1 thing been nagging me. No Feedburner email subscription widget that suits my needs, so decided to make one myself. The result is a simple widget for your themes sidebar that lets your visitors subscribe to you feed in a breeze. [Feedburner email widget](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/feedburner-email-widget/) has been accepted as a plugin bij Wordpress yesterday and the first release was pushed today.
